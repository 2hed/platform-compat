# PC001: API not supported on all platforms

## Cause

You're calling an API in .NET Core or .NET Standard that will throw
`PlatformNotSupportedException` in all or some circumstances.

## Rule Description

The goal of this rule is assisting you in writing robust code that will work
across all platforms that your code might run on.

## How to Fix Violations

The analyzer has no way to detect whether your code is correctly guarded against
`PlatformNotSupportedException`. The fix is to review the API documentation for
which this rule was triggered for and to do one of the following:

1. Not calling the API
2. Guard this call and suppress the specific occurrence of this rule
3. Not running your code on the affected platforms and suppressing this rule for
   said platforms

## When to Suppress Warnings

Unless you stop calling the API entirely, you'll have to suppress this warning.

If you want to suppress a specific occurrence, use `#pragma warning disable`:

```C#
#pragma warning disable PC001 // API not supported on all platforms
    var x = Console.WindowWidth;
#pragma warning restore PC001 // API not supported on all platforms
```

If you want to ignore certain platforms, you need to edit your project file and
add a property `PlatformCompatIgnore` that lists all platforms you don't plan to
run your code on:

```XML
<PropertyGroup>
    <PlatformCompatIgnore>Linux;MacOSX</<PlatformCompatIgnore>
</PropertyGroup>
```
