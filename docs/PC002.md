# PC002: API not available in .NET Framework 4.6.1

## Cause

You're calling an API in .NET Standard that isn't available in .NET Framework
4.6.1.

## Rule Description

While .NET Framework 4.6.1 is treated by NuGet as implementing .NET Standard
2.0, it doesn't fully implement it. This was trade-off that is explained in the
documentation of [.NET Standard][netfx-netstandard].

## How to Fix Violations

You cannot reasonably guard your code against missing APIs. You only have two
options:

1. Not calling the affected API
2. Not running your code on .NET Framework 4.6.1

## When to Suppress Warnings

Unless you stop calling the API entirely, you'll have to suppress this warning:

```C#
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;

[assembly: SuppressMessage("Usage", "PC002:API not available in .NET Framework 4.6.1", Justification = "This library will not run on .NET Framework 4.6.1")]
```
