# PC004: Delegate.BeginInvoke and EndInvoke are Unsupported on .NET Core

## Cause

You're using the [Asynchronous Programming Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/calling-synchronous-methods-asynchronously) to invoke a delegate (via the `BeginInvoke` method) which is unsupported on .NET Core. 

## Rule description

The `BeginInvoke` and `EndInvoke` methods automatically generated for delegate types at compile-time are not supported by .NET Core. Calling these methods will throw a `NotSupportedException`. Task-based [TPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl) patterns should be used instead.

## How to fix violations

Remove calls to `BeginInvoke` and `EndInvoke`. Replace `IAsyncResult` usage with `Task`-based patterns, instead. For example:

```CSharp
delegate int WorkDelegate(int arg);
...
WorkDelegate del = DoWork;

// Schedule the work using a Task
Console.WriteLine("Starting with Task.Run");
var workTask = Task.Run(() => DoWork(11));

// Optionally, we can specify a continuation delegate 
// to execute when DoWork has finished
var followUpTask = workTask.ContinueWith(TaskCallback);

// This writes output to the console while DoWork is running in the background
Console.WriteLine("Waiting on work...");

// We await the task instead of calling EndInvoke
var ret = await workTask;
await folowUpTask;
```

## When to suppress warnings

These methods are never usable on .NET Core. Suppress the warning only if:

1. These code paths are only used while running on .NET Framework.
2. The analyzer has mistakenly flagged an API that is not a call to a compiler-generated `BeginInvoke`/`EndInvoke` APM method.
