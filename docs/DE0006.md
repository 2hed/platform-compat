# DE0006: Non-generic collections shouldn't be used

## Motivation

When .NET was created, generic data types didn't exist, which is why the
collection types in `System.Collections` are untyped. However, since then
generic data types and thus a new set of collections in
`System.Collections.Generic` were made available.

## Recommendation

For new code, you shouldn't use non-generic collections:

* **Error prone**. Since non-generic collections are untyped, it requires frequent
  casting between `object` and the actual type you're expecting. Since the compiler
  can't check that your types are consistent it's easer to put the wrong type in
  the wrong collection.

* **Less performant**. Generic collection have the advantage that value types
  don't have to be boxed as object. For instance, a `List<int>` stores its data
  in an `int[]`. That's far better than storing the data in `object[]` as that
  requires boxing.

Consult the following table which how the non-generic collection types can be
replaced by their generic counterparts in `System.Collections.Generic`:

| Type                              | Replacement                                                |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ArrayList`                       | `List<T>`                                                  |
| `Hashtable`                       | `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`                                 |
| `Queue`                           | `Queue<T>`                                                 |
| `Stack`                           | `Stack<T>`                                                 |
| `SortedList`                      | `SortedList<TKey, TValue>`                                 |
| `DictionaryEntry`                 | `KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>`                               |
| `DictionaryBase`                  | `Dictionary<TKey, TValue> or KeyedCollection<TKey, TItem>` |
| `CollectionBase`                  | `Collection<T>`                                            |
| `ReadOnlyCollectionBase`          | `ReadOnlyCollection<T>`                                    |
| `Comparer`                        | `Comparer<T>`                                              |
| `CaseInsensitiveComparer`         | `StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase`                         |
| `CaseInsensitiveHashCodeProvider` | `StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase`                         |
